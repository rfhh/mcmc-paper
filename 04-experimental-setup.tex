\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{sec-experimental}

Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments described in this paper
were conducted on the VU~Amsterdam and Leiden DAS5 clusters.  The clusters
consists of 68 and 24 compute nodes respectively. Each node is equipped with
a dual 8-core Intel Xeon E5-2630v3 CPU clocked at 2.40GHz, 64GB of memory and
8TB of storage. The nodes of each site are interconnected by FDR~InfiniBand.
Additionally, the VU cluster is fitted with a number of NVidia GPUs including
GTX~\mbox{Titan-X(Pascal)},
GTX~\mbox{Titan-X(Maxwell)}, GTX980, K40c and K20m.

To evaluate our implementations, we use publicly available
community networks from the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP)
collection~\cite{snapnets}, including the largest networks.
Table~\ref{table-snap}
outlines the graph properties of the networks used.
