@article {beam2014fast,
	title = {{Fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using GPU Computing}},
	journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1402.4089},
	year = {2014},
	abstract = {In recent years, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm has
been found to work more efficiently compared to other popular Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods (such as random walk Metropolis-Hastings) in generating samples
from a posterior distribution. A general framework for HMC based on the use of
graphical processing units (GPUs) is shown to greatly reduce the computing time
needed for Bayesian inference. The most expensive computational tasks in HMC are the
evaluation of the posterior kernel and computing its gradient with respect to the
parameters of interest. One of primary goals of this article to show that by
expressing each of these tasks in terms of simple matrix or element-wise operations
and maintaining persistent objects in GPU memory, the computational time can be
drastically reduced. By using GPU objects to perform the entire HMC simulation, most
of the latency penalties associated with transferring data from main to GPU memory
can be avoided. Thus, the proposed computational framework is conceptually very
simple, but also is general enough to be applied to most problems that use HMC
sampling. For clarity of exposition, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated in the high-dimensional setting on a standard statistical model -
multinomial regression. Using GPUs, analyses of data sets that were previously
intractable for fully Bayesian approaches due to the prohibitively high computational
cost are now feasible.},
